# ZeroSum

<p>
Just a simple python <b>api</b> for stock basic requests
</p>

<p>
OpenSource and with free image at dockerhub.
</p>

## Execute it with docker:
<code>
> docker push raulc27/zerosum:latest
</code>

## GenAI Credentials
<p>
GenAi endpoints to work properly, you should have set the GENAI_API_KEY. 
You may use a .env or... set this environment variable in your deployment tool.
</p>

<p>
The last try is once you have your container running, enter in your terminal:
export GENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
dont forget to restart the api (not the container...)
</p>
